                            This is one of my favourite projects. It was birthed from playing 
                            around with someone else's sketch (I unfortunatley can't find the original to give credit).
                            I think this the first time I used modulous, cos and sine in any programming capacity.
                            I had many variations of the sketch but settled on the current version.
                            I intially described it as a pheonix in a constant cycle of rising from the ashes to 
                            die and resurect again. Now that I look at agin it could also be a fallen angel finding redemption.

                            This sketch and many others I have made make me appreciate the verstility of programming. It's not about 
                            always "hacking" and Facebook, Google and other imagerys asscociated with programming. 
                            It can aslo be art and music and other field where programming seems the least likely to occur.

                           This sketch was a bit of a doozy because I was working with the z-axis and a moving terrain.
                           I don't think I knew what I was doing 70% of the time and I had to challenge myslef to 
                           understand the source material to make sound decisions about changes.

                            This was a fun sketch. There were instructions on how to complete this but it was not easy.
                            There was a lot of measuring and forgettin(then quickly remebering) how computer co-ordintaes
                            are horrible. Crying, I might have shed a tear or two during and upon completion
