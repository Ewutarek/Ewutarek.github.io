                            This is one of my favourite projects and it only has 140 characters of code. It was birthed from playing 
                            around with someone else's sketch (I unfortunately cannot find the original to give credit).
                            I think this the first time I used modulus, cos, and sine in any programming capacity.
                            I had many variations of the sketch but settled on the current version.
                            I initially described it as a phoenix in a constant cycle of rising from the ashes to 
                            die and resurrect again. Now that I look at again it could also be a fallen angel finding redemption.

                            This sketch and many others I have made make me appreciate the versatility of programming. It is not about 
                            always "hacking" and Facebook, Google and other imagery associated with programming. 
                            It can also be art and music and other field where programming seems the least likely to occur.

                            This sketch was a bit of a doozy because I was working with the z-axis and a moving terrain.
                            I do not think I knew what I was doing 70% of the time and I had to challenge myself to 
                            understand the source material to make sound decisions about changes.

                            This was a fun sketch. There were instructions on how to complete this, but it was not easy.
                            There was a lot of measuring and forgetting (then quickly remembering) how computer co-ordinates
                            are horrible. Crying, I might have shed a tear or two during and upon completion
